I am interested in how biology and geology coevolve. Currently, I am studying the effects biota have on chemical weathering rates in the Southern Alps of New Zealand.  
  
  
I am earning two PhDs. One in geology under [Kevin Norton](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HOCYhlIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) in the School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences at [Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand](https://www.victoria.ac.nz/sgees/research/phd-profiles/eron-raines) and the second in isotope geochemistry under [Tony Dosseto](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DeHWEEIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) in the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the [University of Wollongong, Australia](https://www.uow.edu.au/science-medicine-health/research/wollongong-isotope-geochronology-laboratory-wigl/people/).  
  
  
My PhD research has put me in some really cool remote settings and on rare occasions even in helicopters. However, I still spend an inordinate amount of time in the lab as well as in front of a computer. Here you will find links to some of the data I have helped collect, some writings, and computer programs I am still working the kinks out of.
